<h2>Motivation</h2><br>
Human segmentation remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, particularly for real-time applications in augmented reality, virtual backgrounds, and autonomous systems. Existing solutions often struggle with accuracy across diverse scenarios and lack the temporal consistency needed for video applications. Our project aimed to develop a robust, production-ready solution that could maintain high accuracy while operating in real-time across varying conditions.

This project addresses the fundamental challenge of accurate human segmentation in computer vision applications, where precise subject isolation is crucial for applications ranging from augmented reality to autonomous systems. Our objective was to develop a high-performance, production-ready computer vision pipeline capable of real-time human segmentation while maintaining high accuracy across diverse scenarios.
<br><br>

<h2>Methods</h2><br>
We implemented a hybrid architecture combining transformer-based attention mechanisms with CNN backbones for optimal performance. The development process began with comprehensive research across 10+ papers to identify state-of-the-art approaches. The training pipeline was built on PyTorch with distributed training capabilities, processing a curated dataset of 200,000+ images. We implemented specialized data augmentation techniques targeting edge cases and challenging scenarios. The system incorporated three main components: a portrait matting module for fine-grained segmentation, a multi-class body part segmentation system, and an anatomical landmark detector for enhanced accuracy.


<br><br>
<h2>Results</h2><br>
The implemented system achieved a 15% improvement in segmentation accuracy compared to baseline models through targeted data augmentation and custom loss function implementation. Video segmentation performance increased by 40% through the integration of the detect-and-track system and quantization-aware training optimizations. The pipeline maintained real-time performance while processing complex scenes, with consistent accuracy across varying lighting conditions and poses.

<h2>Discussion</h2><br>
The project successfully delivered a production-ready human segmentation pipeline with robust performance across diverse scenarios. Key insights included the effectiveness of hybrid architectures in balancing accuracy and performance, the critical role of comprehensive data augmentation in handling edge cases, and the importance of temporal consistency in video applications. The visualization tools developed during the project proved invaluable for debugging and performance optimization, while the distributed training infrastructure significantly accelerated the development cycle.
