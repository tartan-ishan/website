I am a recent graduate from Carnegie Mellon University with a Master's degree. I have extensive knowledge and experience in machine learning frameworks and their applications in various fields, including robotics, autonomous driving, and aviation. I am also interested in and have experience with multimodal machine learning, self-supervised learning, on-device machine learning, and model compression for optimization and improved efficiency.
